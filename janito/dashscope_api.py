"""
DashScope SDK client module for sending prompts through the **native**
DashScope SDK (``dashscope.Generation.call``).

This is the counterpart of :mod:`janito.openai_client.completions_api` for the
``"DashScope"`` API type: the same config resolution, tool loading, MCP
support, progress spinner, reasoning panel, used-files report
and token-usage summary, but talking to the DashScope native API through the
official ``dashscope`` package instead of an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The ``dashscope`` package is **optional**: the API type is only accepted by
``--set api-type=DashScope`` when the package is installed
(``janito.providers.REQUIRES_BY_API_TYPE``), and this module refuses to run
without it, with an actionable install message.  Because the package may be
absent, the import happens lazily inside :func:`_create_client` (checked with
``importlib.util.find_spec``, mirroring the web-mode extra check) rather than
at module import time, so importing ``janito`` never requires ``dashscope``.

Like the Completions implementation, this module owns the conversation
history **client-side**: the DashScope generation API is stateless, so every
turn re-sends the full ``messages`` list.  Tool calls are executed with the
shared :class:`~janito.tooling.executor.ToolExecutor` and their ``tool``-role
messages are appended to the history before the next round, repeating until
the model emits a final text answer.  ``send_prompt`` returns the assistant
text and mutates ``previous_messages`` in place (Completions-style), so the
interactive shell treats this mode exactly like Completions.

Unlike the OpenAI-compatible types, the DashScope SDK talks to the **native**
DashScope API (``https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/api/v1`` for the
international region).  The base URL is a module-level global on the
``dashscope`` package (``dashscope.base_http_api_url``); it is set from the
provider's ``endpoint_by_api_type`` map (or a config endpoint override) before
each call.

The DashScope stream handling lives in
:mod:`janito.openai_client.dashscope_stream` and the shared client helpers in
:mod:`janito.openai_client.client_support`; both are re-exported here so
existing ``dashscope_api.<name>`` references keep working.

    The ``dashscope`` package is optional (see
    ``janito.providers.REQUIRES_BY_API_TYPE``), so its availability is checked
    explicitly with ``importlib.util.find_spec`` (mirroring the web-mode extra
    check) and the import happens lazily -- importing ``janito`` never
    requires ``dashscope``.

    The DashScope SDK is stateless at the module level: the base URL is a
    module global (``dashscope.base_http_api_url``) and the API key is passed
    per call.  This helper therefore returns a lightweight handle carrying
    the resolved ``base_url`` / ``api_key`` for the call loop instead of a
    client object.

    Args:
        base_url: The native-SDK base URL (from the provider's
            ``endpoint_by_api_type`` map or a config endpoint override).
        api_key: The API key from the auth store.

    Returns:
        A ``SimpleNamespace`` with ``base_url`` and ``api_key``.

    arrives in ``config`` -- built once per session by ``build_api_config`` --
    so this entry point performs no config-store / auth-store reads of its
    own.

    The conversation history is owned **client-side**: ``previous_messages``
    is mutated in place (user and assistant turns are appended) so the
    interactive shell's history keeps growing, exactly like Completions mode.

        config: The resolved, immutable
            :class:`~janito.openai_client.api_config.APIConfig` for this

        prompt: The user prompt to send
        previous_messages: List of previous message dicts for conversation
            context (mutated in place).  DashScope accepts ``system``-role
            messages directly, so no extraction is needed (unlike the
            Anthropic Messages API).
        instructions: Accepted for signature parity with the other clients.
            DashScope takes the system prompt as a ``system``-role message in
            ``messages``; when provided as a string it is prepended as one.
        tools: Optional list of tool schemas to pass. If None, uses all
            available tools. If an empty list, no tools are passed.
        usage_out: Optional out-param (a
            :class:`~janito.openai_client.client_support.TurnUsage`) populated
            with the turn's usage and display metadata, so the caller can
            render the end-of-turn reports after the call returns (see
            :func:`~janito.openai_client.client_support.display_turn_usage`).

    Returns:
        The assistant's final text (after any tool-call rounds).

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the ``dashscope`` package is not installed.

    Note:
        Thinking mode is resolved into ``config.thinking`` at build time: the
        explicit ``--thinking`` / ``/thinking`` flag wins, otherwise the
        provider's built-in default applies (``True`` for Alibaba/Qwen,
