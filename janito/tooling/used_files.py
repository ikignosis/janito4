"""Track which files were READ and WRITE by tool calls during a prompt.

Whenever a tool is invoked whose *first* argument is named ``filepath``, the
value of that argument is recorded in one (or both) of two lists \u2014 ``READ``
and ``WRITE`` \u2014 depending on the tool's declared permissions. The permissions
string is the one set by the ``@tool(permissions="\u2026")`` decorator (e.g.
``"r"``, ``"w"``, ``"rw"``):

* if it contains ``'r'`` the path is appended to the ``READ`` list;
* if it contains ``'w'`` the path is appended to the ``WRITE`` list.

Filenames are unique within each list: a path already present is not added
again. The lists are kept in memory for the lifetime of the process and can be
rendered as a ``Used files`` report that is printed (via ``rich``) before the
token-usage summary.

:class:`UsedFilesTracker` implements the tracking logic (the module functions
below delegate to a module-level singleton).  Like
:mod:`janito.tooling.tools_usage` and :mod:`janito.tooling.changes`, tracking
is deliberately defensive: it is a best-effort side feature and must never be
able to break tool execution or the agent loop, so every access is wrapped and
failures are swallowed.
