"""Track the tool executions that changed files during a session.

Whenever a *successful* tool call has ``filepath`` as its first argument and
declares write permission (its permission string contains ``"w"``), the tool
name and its invocation parameters are appended to a JSON-lines file
(``./.janito/changes.jsonl``, relative to the current working directory).
Read-only tools that happen to take a ``filepath`` first argument (e.g.
``ReadFile``) are excluded, so the log only ever describes genuine changes.
Only the parameters are recorded \u2014 never the tool's result. The file is
meant to be removed before a new user prompt is requested for processing, so
it always describes the changes made while handling the *current* prompt.

The :func:`/changes` interactive command reads this file back and renders each
recorded execution in a friendly, human-readable format:

* ``CreateFile`` \u2014 the written ``content`` is shown with rich syntax
  highlighting (the language is guessed from the file path).
* ``ReplaceTextInFile`` \u2014 a unified diff between ``old_str`` and ``new_str``
  is generated and shown with the Pygments "diff" lexer; added lines get a
  green background and removed lines a red background (see
  :class:`janito.tooling.reporter.DiffTheme`).
* Any other tool \u2014 its parameters are shown as pretty-printed JSON.

:class:`ChangesTracker` implements the recording/rendering logic (the module
functions below delegate to a module-level singleton); the state lives on disk
under the current working directory.  Like :mod:`janito.tooling.tools_usage`
and :mod:`janito.tooling.used_files`, recording is deliberately defensive:
tracking is a best-effort side feature and must never be able to break tool
execution or the agent loop, so every access is wrapped and failures are
swallowed.
