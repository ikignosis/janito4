"""
Tool usage tracking backed by an SQLite database.

Every time a tool is invoked (from either the CLI agent loop or the web
backend), :func:`record_tool_use` should be called with the tool's name. The
usage counters are persisted in ``tools_use.db`` inside the Janito config
directory (see :mod:`janito.config_dir`), in a single table with the columns
``tool_name`` and ``use_count``.

:class:`ToolUsageStore` implements the database access (the module functions
below delegate to a module-level singleton).  The functions in this module are
deliberately defensive: they never raise.  Tracking is a best-effort side
feature and must not be able to break tool execution or the agent loop, so
every database access is wrapped and failures are swallowed (optionally
logged).
