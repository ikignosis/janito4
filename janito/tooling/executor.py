"""
ToolExecutor - executes the tool calls the model makes during an agent turn.

This module centralises the tool-execution logic that was previously embedded
in the CLI agent loop (``janito/llm_clients/openai/completions_api.py``): routing each tool
call to either the MCP manager or the built-in tools registry, tracking tool
usage / used files / changes, and producing the ``tool``-role messages that
are appended to the conversation history. Failures are converted into
structured error results rather than being raised to the caller, so a failing
tool never aborts the agent loop.

    This is the **shared tool-execution core** used by both agent loops:

    - the CLI ``ToolExecutor.execute_tool_call`` (called synchronously),
    - the web agent loop, which runs it in a thread via
      ``asyncio.to_thread`` (``janito.web.backend.agent.tooling.execute_tool``).

    It routes the call to the MCP manager or the built-in tools registry,
    tracks usage / used files / changes (best-effort, never raises), and
    converts a failing call into a structured ``{"success": False, ...}``
    result instead of raising, so a failing tool never aborts the agent
    loop.  When ``progress`` is given, it is installed as the report handler
    for the duration of the call, so every ``report_*`` line the tool emits
    is forwarded to it (web mode); the CLI passes ``None`` and keeps the
    default Rich console output.

    Args:
        tool_name: The tool to invoke.
        tool_args: The arguments to pass to the tool.
        use_mcp: Whether MCP routing is enabled. When ``True``, MCP tools
            (resolved via :func:`is_mcp_tool`) go to the manager; otherwise

        progress: Optional ``(level, message, end)`` report callback.
        allowed_tools: Optional set of tool names the current turn may call

            call to any other tool is rejected with a structured error
            before anything executes -- the model may only call the tools
            that were offered in this turn.  ``None`` disables the gate.

    Returns:
