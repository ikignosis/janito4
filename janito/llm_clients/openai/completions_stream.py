"""
Stream consumption for the Chat Completions API.

These helpers are shared by the OpenAI-compatible clients that talk to
``client.chat.completions.create`` with streaming enabled.  They assemble the
streamed deltas (content, reasoning/thinking text and tool-call arguments,
which arrive split across many chunks) into a single response.

The per-chunk folding lives in the shared
:class:`~janito.llm_adapters.completions.CompletionsTurnAccumulator` (used directly by
the web loop); :class:`CompletionsStreamConsumer` adds
the CLI-specific driver — :meth:`consume` walks a sync stream with
Enter-to-cancel support and returns the response parts.  The module-level
``_consume_stream`` / ``_consume_chunk`` / ``_consume_tool_call_delta``
functions are thin delegators used by ``_stream_response`` and its tests.
