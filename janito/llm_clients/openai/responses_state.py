"""
Conversation-state helpers for the Responses API client.

The Responses API keeps the conversation server-side for most providers
(``responses_in_server`` True) and chains turns with
``previous_response_id``; stateless providers (e.g. DeepSeek) cannot resolve
a previous response id, so the client tracks the full conversation as
Responses input items and re-sends them on every request.  These helpers
build that per-round state and the call parameters; they were extracted from
:mod:`janito.llm_clients.openai.conversations_api`.
