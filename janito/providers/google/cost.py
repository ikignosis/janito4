"""Cost estimation for the Google (Gemini) provider.

Rates source
------------
The per-1M-token rates below were taken from the official Google Gemini
rate card at https://ai.google.dev/pricing and apply as of the verification
date.  Google adjusts figures frequently, so cross-check that page before
relying on them.
"""

#: Per-1M-token rates (USD) keyed by model name:
#: ``(input cache miss, input cache hit, output)``.
#:
#: Google applies context caching: cached input tokens are billed at the
#: context cache read rate ($0.1875/1M, 25% of input token price).
#: There is no peak-hour surcharge.
