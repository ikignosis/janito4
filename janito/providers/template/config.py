"""Template provider configuration -- reference for every CONFIG option.

This module is **not** a real provider: it is never imported into
:data:`janito.providers._PROVIDER_CONFIGS` and its ``PROVIDER_CONFIG`` is
only a documentation skeleton.  It is the template for writing a new
provider's ``config.py``: every possible CONFIG option is shown below,
fully commented, in one ``PROVIDER_CONFIG`` dict.

To add a provider, copy this file to ``janito/providers/<name>/config.py``,
fill in the real values, and register the entry in
:data:`janito.providers._PROVIDER_CONFIGS` (inside ``janito/providers/
__init__.py``).

See also:

  - :mod:`janito.providers` -- how the per-provider entries are assembled
    into the registry (including the ``REQUIRES_BY_API_TYPE`` optional-
    package map that native-SDK API types must be added to).
  - :mod:`janito.providers.models` -- how each CONFIG option is read and
    applied at runtime.

#: The config entry for the ``<name>`` provider.
#:
#: The entry has two levels.  The *provider level* holds what is intrinsic
#: to the provider; everything that depends on the model lives under the
#: per-provider ``models`` dict, keyed by model name.
PROVIDER_CONFIG: dict = {
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Provider-level fields

    #: The model used when the user has not configured one.  ``None`` means
    #: the provider has no sensible default and the user must set a model
    #: explicitly (e.g. the "custom" provider).  The name doubles as the
    #: key of the model's entry in ``models``.
    "default_model": "my-default-model",
    #: The OpenAI-compatible base URL.  ``None`` means the standard OpenAI
    #: API endpoint (no custom base URL needed); the special
    #: ``CUSTOM_ENDPOINT`` marker (see ``janito/providers/custom/config.py``)
    #: means the endpoint must come from config (only the "custom" provider
    #: uses it).
    "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/v1",
    #: Per-API-type base URLs (optional).  Lets a provider declare a
    #: different URL per API type, e.g. the native-SDK URL next to the
    #: OpenAI-compatible one.  A dict holding a single entry uses that URL
    #: as the default for *any* API type (unless a config endpoint is set);
    #: with multiple entries, each API type maps to its own URL and an API
    #: type absent from the map falls back to the single ``endpoint``
    #: above.  Omit the key entirely when every API type shares
    #: ``endpoint``.

    #: adjustments: the ``enable_thinking`` extra-body flag is **not** sent

    #: reason by default).  Absent (or ``False``) means the provider follows
