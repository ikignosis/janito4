"""Cost estimation for the Xiaomi provider.

Rates source
------------
The per-1M-token rates below are the official Xiaomi pricing for the
MiMo-V2.5 model (international, USD, per 1M tokens): $0.14 input cache
miss, $0.0028 input cache hit and $0.28 output.  They apply as of the
verification date.  Xiaomi adjusts figures frequently, so cross-check the
official rate card before relying on them.

Prompt caching
--------------
Xiaomi applies automatic prompt caching: repeated input tokens (a stable
system prompt, a long document, few-shot examples) are billed at the much
lower cache-hit rate ($0.0028/1M, 2% of the cache-miss input rate) instead
of the cache-miss rate.  There is no peak-hour surcharge.
