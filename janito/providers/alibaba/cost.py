------------
The per-1M-token rates below were taken from the official QwenCloud model
marketplace pages https://www.qwencloud.com/models/qwen3.8-max (last
verified 2026-08-15) and https://www.qwencloud.com/models/qwen3.8-flash
(verified 2026-08-27) and apply as of the verification dates.  Alibaba
adjusts figures frequently, so cross-check the official rate card at
https://www.qwencloud.com/pricing/token-plan before relying on them.

#: Per-1M-token rates (USD) keyed by model name:
#: ``(input cache miss, input cache hit, output)``.
#:
#: Alibaba applies automatic prefix caching: repeated input tokens (a
#: stable system prompt, a long document, few-shot examples) are billed at
#: the much lower implicit cache-hit rate instead of the cache-miss rate.
#: There is no peak-hour surcharge.
