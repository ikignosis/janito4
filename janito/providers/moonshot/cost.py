"""Cost estimation for the Moonshot (Kimi) provider.

Rates source
------------
The per-1M-token rates below are taken from the official Moonshot AI
pricing for the Kimi K3 model family (``kimi-k3``) and apply as of the
verification date.  The rate card lists prices in CNY (¥20.00 input cache
miss, ¥2.00 input cache hit, ¥100.00 output per 1M tokens), which
correspond to approximately $2.75 / $0.28 / $13.75 per 1M tokens.  Moonshot
adjusts figures frequently, so cross-check the official rate card before
relying on them.

Prompt caching
--------------
Moonshot applies automatic context caching: cached input tokens are billed
at the much lower cache-hit rate (¥2.00/1M, 10% of the cache-miss input
rate) instead of the cache-miss rate.  There is no peak-hour surcharge.
