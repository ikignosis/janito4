"""Cost estimation for the xAI (Grok) provider.

Rates source
------------
The per-1M-token rates below were taken from the official xAI pricing
tables at https://docs.x.ai/developers/models (last verified 2026-08-18)
and apply as of the verification date.  xAI adjusts figures frequently,
so cross-check that page before relying on them.

Long-context prompts
--------------------
Requests whose input exceeds 200K tokens are billed at 2x the standard
rates ($4.00/1M input, $1.00/1M cached input, $12.00/1M output) for the
**whole** request -- not just the portion above the threshold.  Cached-input
reads scale with the input rate, so they are also billed at 2x ($1.00/1M)
in long-context mode.

Prompt caching
--------------
xAI applies automatic prompt caching: repeated input tokens (a stable
system prompt, a long document, few-shot examples) are billed at the much
lower cache-hit rate ($0.50/1M, 25% of the input rate) instead of the
cache-miss rate.  There is no peak-hour surcharge.
