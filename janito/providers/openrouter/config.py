"""Built-in configuration for the OpenRouter provider.

``PROVIDER_CONFIG`` is the config entry for ``openrouter``.  OpenRouter is an
aggregator: it proxies models from many providers behind a single
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it has no single sensible default model.
Like the ``custom`` provider it therefore requires the user to pick a model
explicitly (``--model`` or ``providers.openrouter.model`` in config.json).

Unlike ``custom``, it ships a built-in endpoint and a placeholder
``custom`` model entry that only carries built-in defaults (the default API
type), so API-type resolution still works before a model is configured.
The placeholder default model is not a real model name: runtime model
resolution treats it as "no model configured" and informs the user (see
``janito.provider_accessors.requires_explicit_model`` and
``janito.llm_clients.openai.completions_api.resolve_runtime_config``).

See :mod:`janito.providers.template.config` for the full reference of every
CONFIG option.
