"""Cost estimation for the MiniMax provider.

Rates source
------------
The per-1M-token rates below are based on the official MiniMax Pay-as-You-Go
Standard Tier pricing at https://platform.minimax.io/docs/guides/pricing-paygo
and apply as of the verification date.

High-context prompts
--------------------
Requests whose input exceeds 512K tokens (> 512,000 tokens) are billed at
2x the standard input rate ($0.60/1M) and 2x the standard output rate
($2.40/1M) for the whole request. Cached-input reads scale with the input
rate, so they are also billed at 2x ($0.12/1M) in high-context mode.

Prompt caching
--------------
MiniMax applies prompt cache reads: cached input tokens are billed at
$0.06/1M tokens (20% of the uncached input rate, or $0.12/1M in high-context
mode).
