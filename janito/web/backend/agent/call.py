"""Completions adapter for the web agentic loop — shared with the CLI loop.

The call-parameter building and stream accumulation now live in
:mod:`janito.agent.completions` (the shared per-API adapter layer used by
both the CLI ``Client.run_turn`` and the web ``stream_prompt`` loops).  This
module re-exports them under their historical web names so the orchestration
loop (``loop.py``) and existing tests keep their import paths.
