"""In-browser user prompting for the web agent (AskUser tool).

The AskUser tool's ``prompt_user`` normally reads from stdin; in web mode
there is no console. The web backend instead installs a
:class:`WebPromptHandler` (via :func:`janito.tooling.prompting.set_prompt_handler`)
that presents the question in a non-blocking inline card in the browser
chat and waits for the answer:

1. the tool runs in a worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) and calls
   ``prompt_user``, which invokes the installed handler synchronously;
2. the handler registers a :class:`PendingPrompt` in the connection's
   :class:`PromptRegistry`, schedules a ``{"type": "prompt", ...}`` message
   on the WebSocket (via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe``) and blocks the worker
   thread on the prompt's event;
3. the WebSocket receive loop (``_await_cancel`` in ``routers/chat.py``)
   resolves the prompt when the browser posts
   ``{"type": "prompt_answer", ...}``;
4. the worker thread wakes up and returns the answer to the tool.

The registry is created once per WebSocket connection in
``routers/chat.chat_websocket`` and shared by the receive loop and the
prompt handler, so multiple concurrent questions per connection (e.g. two
AskUser calls in one turn) each get their own ``prompt_id``.
