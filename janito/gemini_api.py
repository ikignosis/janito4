"""
Gemini SDK client module for sending prompts through the **native** Gemini
API (``client.models.generate_content_stream``, the stable ``generateContent``
API from the ``google-genai`` package).

This is the counterpart of :mod:`janito.openai_client.completions_api` for the
``"Gemini"`` API type: the same config resolution, tool loading, MCP support,
progress spinner, reasoning panel, used-files report and token-usage summary,
but talking to the native Gemini API through the official ``google-genai``
package instead of Google's OpenAI-compatibility layer.

The ``google-genai`` package is **optional**: the API type is only accepted by
``--set api-type=Gemini`` when the package is installed
(``janito.providers.REQUIRES_BY_API_TYPE``), and this module refuses to run
without it, with an actionable install message.  Because the package may be
absent, the import happens lazily inside :func:`_create_client` (checked with
``importlib.util.find_spec``, mirroring the web-mode extra check) rather than
at module import time, so importing ``janito`` never requires ``google-genai``.

Like the Completions implementation, this module owns the conversation history
**client-side**: the Gemini ``generateContent`` API is stateless, so every
turn re-sends the full ``contents`` list (plus the top-level
``system_instruction``).  Tool calls are executed with the shared
:class:`~janito.tooling.executor.ToolExecutor` and their ``function_response``
parts are appended to the history before the next round, repeating until the
model emits a final text answer.  ``send_prompt`` returns the assistant text
and mutates ``previous_messages`` in place (Completions-style), so the
interactive shell treats this mode exactly like Completions.

Gemini 3.x models reason by default: thought parts stream alongside the
answer and are surfaced in the reasoning panel.  Stateless multi-turn
requests must resend the model's thought blocks verbatim, so the client keeps
them (``thought_parts`` plus the per-call ``thought_signature``) in the
client-side history and echoes them back on the next round.

The Gemini stream handling lives in :mod:`janito.openai_client.gemini_stream`
and the wire-format helpers in :mod:`janito.gemini_helpers`; both are
re-exported here so existing ``gemini_api.<name>`` references keep working.
