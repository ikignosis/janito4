"""
Command autocompletion for the interactive shell.

Provides a :class:`prompt_toolkit` ``Completer`` that suggests registered
slash commands (e.g. ``/tools``, ``/help``) as the user types. Suggestions
only appear once the current token starts with a ``/`` **and** that token
is the first one on the line, so regular chat input is left untouched.

Commands that take an argument can register an *argument completer*: a
callable that receives the current word and returns the candidate argument
values. When the line so far matches ``/cmd <word>`` the candidates are
offered instead, e.g. ``/provider`` suggests the available provider names
and ``/model`` the models available from the current provider.

    """Autocomplete registered shell commands that start with ``/``.

    The completer inspects the word currently being typed. If that word
    starts with ``/`` (for example ``/t``) **and** is the first token on
    the line, every registered command whose name starts with the same
    prefix is offered as a completion, sorted alphabetically. A ``/`` that
    appears in the middle of a prompt is treated as regular chat text and
    yields no suggestions, keeping plain chat input free of command noise.

    When a registered command declares an argument completer (via
    ``arg_completers``), typing ``/cmd <word>`` offers that command's
    candidate argument values instead of command names.

    Args:
        commands: A zero-argument callable returning the current list of
            registered command handlers. Passing a callable (rather than a
            fixed list) keeps the completer in sync with commands registered
            after the completer is created.
        arg_completers: Optional mapping from command name (e.g. ``"/provider"``)
            to a callable that receives the current word and returns the
            candidate argument values (e.g. the available provider names).
