"""
/read command handler - sends a prompt to the LLM using the main conversation
history but restricted to read-only tools.

Unlike ``/ask`` (which starts a fresh, isolated chat history), ``/read`` sends
the prompt through the main conversation: the model sees the ongoing history
and the exchange is appended to it (rollback/cancel behaviour matches a normal
prompt). The only difference is that ``tools=`` is filtered down to the
read-only tools -- the built-in tools whose ``@tool(permissions="r")``
declares read access and nothing else, so the model can inspect, search and
fetch but cannot write or execute.
