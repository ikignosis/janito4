/write command handler - sends a prompt to the LLM using the main conversation
history but restricted to write-only tools.

Unlike ``/ask`` (which starts a fresh, isolated chat history), ``/write`` sends
the prompt through the main conversation: the model sees the ongoing history
and the exchange is appended to it (rollback/cancel behaviour matches a normal
prompt). The only difference is that ``tools=`` is filtered down to the
write-only tools -- the built-in tools whose ``@tool(permissions="w")``
declares write access and nothing else, so the model can create, modify or
delete but cannot read, search or execute.
