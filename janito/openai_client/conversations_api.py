"""
OpenAI client module for sending prompts to OpenAI-compatible endpoints using
the Responses API (``client.responses.create``) with server-side conversation
state.

This module mirrors :mod:`janito.openai_client.completions_api` (same config
resolution, tool loading, MCP support, progress spinner, reasoning panel,
used-files report and token-usage summary), but targets the Responses API
instead of the Chat Completions API.

The important difference is **who owns the conversation history**. The
Completions implementation stores and updates a ``messages`` list on the
client side. This module delegates to the server: the Responses API keeps the
conversation server-side and turns are chained with ``previous_response_id``::

    result = run_turn("First question")
    result = run_turn("Follow-up", previous_response_id=result.response_id)

Tool calls work the same way: the model's ``function_call`` output items are
executed and the results are sent back as ``function_call_output`` input items
chained to the response that produced the calls, repeating until the model
emits a final text answer. Only the final ``response_id`` needs to be kept by
the caller.

**Stateless endpoints.** Some providers' ``/responses`` endpoint is stateless
(``responses_in_server`` is ``False`` in the provider's model config, e.g.
DeepSeek):
it cannot resolve a ``previous_response_id`` and rejects tool outputs that
reference it. For those providers the client falls back to the Completions
model of ownership: the full conversation is tracked as Responses input items
(``ConversationResult.input_items``) and re-sent on every request via
``previous_items``, with the system instructions folded into the first turn.

The Responses API stream handling lives in
:mod:`janito.openai_client.responses_stream` and the shared client helpers in
:mod:`janito.openai_client.client_support`; both are re-exported here so
existing ``conversations_api.<name>`` references keep working.

    Attributes:
        content: The assistant's final text (after any tool-call rounds).
        response_id: The server-side id of the final response. For providers
            that keep the conversation server-side (``responses_in_server``
            True), pass it as ``previous_response_id`` to the next
            ``run_turn`` call to continue the conversation. For stateless
            providers (``responses_in_server`` False) this is always ``None``
            and the history is carried client-side in ``input_items`` instead.
        message_count: Number of responses chained during this turn (1 +
            number of tool-call rounds).
        input_items: The full conversation as Responses input items, only for
            stateless providers (``responses_in_server`` False). Pass it back
            as ``previous_items`` to the next ``run_turn`` call so the
            entire history is re-sent (the server keeps no state). ``None``

            (``previous_items`` is then only used to carry the pending user
            messages of an Enter-cancelled turn).
        turn_items: Display-only mirror of the completed turn as Responses
            input items (the user prompt, the assistant text and
            ``function_call`` / ``function_call_output`` items of any
            tool-call rounds, and the final assistant text).  Kept so the
            shell can render ``/history`` for server-side Responses
            providers, whose real conversation lives on the server and is
            never fetched back.  ``None`` only for turn results that did not

    arrives in ``config`` -- built once per session by ``build_api_config`` --
    so this entry point performs no config-store / auth-store reads of its

    The conversation history lives **server-side**: the client neither
    stores nor updates a ``messages`` list. Multi-turn conversations chain

            the ``response_id`` of the previous ``ConversationResult``. Only
            used for providers whose Responses API keeps server-side state
            (``responses_in_server`` True); ignored for stateless providers.
        previous_items: For stateless providers (``responses_in_server``
            False), the full conversation as Responses input items (obtained
            from the previous result's ``input_items``), which cannot resolve
            a ``previous_response_id`` and must re-send the entire history on
            every request. For server-side providers it may carry the pending
            user messages of an Enter-cancelled turn, which are re-sent as
            input items chained from ``previous_response_id`` (the last
            completed response). ``None`` for a fresh conversation.
        instructions: System instructions for the conversation. For server-side
            providers they are only sent on the first turn (the server folds
            them into the stored conversation); for stateless providers they
            are folded into the client-side history on the first turn so every
            request carries the full context.
        tools: Optional list of tool schemas to pass. If None, uses all
            available tools. If an empty list, no tools are passed.
        usage_out: Optional out-param (a
            :class:`~janito.openai_client.client_support.TurnUsage`) populated
            with the turn's usage and display metadata, so the caller can

        provider's conversation model, the server-side response id (to chain
        the next turn with ``previous_response_id``) or the full client-side
        input items (to re-send with ``previous_items``).

    Note:
        Thinking mode is resolved into ``config.thinking`` at build time: the
        explicit ``--thinking`` / ``/thinking`` flag wins, otherwise the
