### Fixed

- `scripts/promote_changelog.py`: write a single trailing newline even when
  `[Unreleased]` is the last section of the file (post-release-reset state);
  the missing newline made pre-commit's `end-of-file-fixer` rewrite the file
  and abort the release commit.

Changes since `v4.32.0` (2026-08-28).
