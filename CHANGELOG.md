## [Unreleased](https://github.com/joaompinto/janito/compare/v4.29.0...HEAD)

Changes since `v4.29.0` (2026-08-20).

### Added

- Interactive chat now prints the resolved provider, model and API type
  (colorized) before starting the session, annotated with `(server-side)` or
  `(client-side)` depending on the `responses-in-server` ("keep in server")
  config.

### Changed

- DeepSeek cost estimates now apply the peak/off-peak split only on
  weekdays (Monday to Friday in Beijing Time).  On weekends (Saturday and
  Sunday in Beijing Time) the peak-hour divisions no longer apply: every
  call is charged uniformly at the off-peak rate for the whole day.
  Reference requests are unaffected (they keep billing at the peak rates
  regardless of the request time and day).

- Conversation history checkpoints are now kept as a list instead of a
  single value: a checkpoint is recorded every time a new user prompt is
  about to be sent, holding the number of rows `/history` would render at
  that moment (so the value indexes directly into the displayed history in
  every API mode). `/history` shows a numbered marker (`◉ checkpoint N`) on
  the position where each checkpoint was added, and `/rewind` steps back
  one turn at a time through the checkpoint list. The web backend mirrors
  the same list-based checkpoint behaviour for Ctrl+C / error rollback.
