functions as tools that should be included in the auto-discovery process.

    Decorator to explicitly mark a function or class as an AI tool.
    
    Functions or classes decorated with @tool will be automatically discovered
    and included in the tools registry when their toolset is loaded.
    
    For functions:
        - The function itself becomes the tool
        - Permissions are stored on the function object
        
    For classes (that inherit from BaseTool):
        - The class must implement a `run` method
        - An instance is created and the `run` method is called
        - Permissions are stored on the class
        
    Args:
        obj (Callable or Type, optional): The function or class to mark as a tool
        permissions (str): Permission string indicating required permissions:
            - "r": read access (files, directories, system info)
            - "w": write access (create, modify, delete files/directories)
            - "x": execute access (run commands, scripts, programs)
            - "n": network access (HTTP requests, network operations)
            - Combinations like "rw", "rx", "rwx" are allowed

        Callable or Type: The original function/class with _is_tool and _tool_permissions attributes set
