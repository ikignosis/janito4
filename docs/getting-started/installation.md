# Installation

This guide covers how to install janito.

## From PyPI

The easiest way to install janito is from PyPI:

```bash
pip install janito
```

Or, with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```bash
uv tool install janito
```

## From Source

For development or the latest features, install from source:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Git
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (project & package manager)
- GitHub CLI (optional)

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joaompinto/janito.git
cd janito

# Create the virtual environment and install the project + dev dependencies
uv sync
```

`uv sync` installs janito in **editable mode** by default and installs the `dev`
dependency group. An editable install means your source-code changes take effect
immediately without reinstalling (the equivalent of `pip install -e .`). To also
install the documentation tooling:

```bash
uv sync --group docs
```

### Running Without Installation

You can also run janito directly from the synced environment:

```bash
uv run python -m janito "Your prompt here"
```

## Verify Installation

Check that janito is installed correctly:

```bash
uv run janito --version
```

> When running from a git checkout (editable install), `--version` shows the
> version derived from the latest git tag (e.g. `4.33.0.post1+g6412eb8`);
> installed wheels/sdists show the released version from the distribution
> metadata.

Or run the help command:

```bash
uv run janito --help
```
